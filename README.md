## morse code "keyboard"
  - arduino sends dots, dashes or spaces via serial
  - python client decodes (i want to do this in c# but i need to find some time to do that first, so i made it in python really quick using a morse code and serial library)
  - i also want to make it so it actually acts like a keyboard and types but that is for later
